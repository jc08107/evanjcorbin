          <p>Matt Daughtry has always felt like he and his parents live in separate worlds - his shaped by the urbane, Northeastern liberal elite, theirs by Southern conservatism, homespun "common sense," and talk show-fueled conspiracies. His homosexuality remains an open secret, something they sidestep rather than confront, much less accept. When he and his sister return for Christmas, the wrong sibling brings home a boyfriend for the first time.</p>
          <p>What starts as a tense but routine holiday gathering takes a surreal turn the next morning. Flights are canceled, pilots and flight attendants mysteriously take time off, and by the following day, an estimated seventy-eight million Americans fail to return to work. Their explanation? They just want to spend more time with their families. Christmas can be every day when you're with family.</p>
          <p>His parents - and millions of Americans - are suffering from a bizarre condition, trapped in an endless holiday loop, determined to celebrate Christmas every day. They make choices that go against their self-interests. Blissfully unbothered by their accumulating debts, economic collapse, or even basic responsibilities, they live in a festive delusion seemingly fueled by an addictive algorithm used by an evangelical shopping app called MerryNet.</p>
          <p>At first, Matt sees no reason to get involved. He's never been able to reach his parents before - why would this be any different? But as the syndrome spreads, paralyzing the country, he stumbles upon evidence linking the outbreak to corporate actors intent on silencing their perceived right-wing enemies. Faced with a choice between complicity and action, Matt realizes that exposing the truth may come at the cost of his career, safety, and sanity. But the country may slide further into a dystopian nightmare if he doesn't act.</p>
          <p>With the help of his boyfriend and sister, Matt must not only uncover the syndrome's cause and cure but also confront the deeper divisions tearing his family - and the nation - apart.</p>
          <p>This is a work of speculative fiction and satire.</p>
